# Game Pass Recommender

## Motivation
Project made for Expert Systems class at AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow

## Run
To run server use
```bash
swipl
[http_server].
```
To run frontend use
```bash
npm start
```
**_NOTE:_**  You may be asked it it's ok to run JS frontend on a different port, as prolog server has occupied the current

You can then use the app at 
```localhost:3000``` or ```localhost:3001```
